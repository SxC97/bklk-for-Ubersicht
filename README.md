# Description
This plugin displays the Date, the Fuzzy Time, and a Binary Clock that updates every second.

This widget is a cobbling together of Joel Eisner's [Binary Clock Widget](https://github.com/joeleisner/ubersicht-binary-clock), Geoff Oliver's [Fuzzy Time Widget](https://github.com/plan8studios/fuzzytime), and Spencer Kaiser's [Simple Date Widget](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht-widgets/blob/master/SimpleDate/index.coffee) to recreate Ruunyox's [bklk](https://github.com/Ruunyox/bklk) terminal application. If you like this widget, please checkout everyone listed above, as this project couldn't have been done without their hard work!

# Installation
Drag and drop into the Ubersicht widgets folder

# Dependencies
[Ubersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) and [FuraCode NerdFont Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) although the font can be changed to whatever you want.

# Customization
The time and date widgets should be centered on any display but the binary clock might need to be manually adjusted using the variables at the top of the document.I have included a Laptop version that should already be centered for 13" screens, a Landscape version that should be centered for 27" 4k monitors, and a Portrait version that should be centered for 27" 4k monitors in portrait mode.

# FAQ

###### Q: What color is your wallpaper?

###### A: The hexcode of the color is #202020 and is a good match for bklk. You can set a custom color in System Preferences/Desktop & Screen Saver/Colors/Custom Color...

###### Q: What's that widget in your menubar?

###### A: That's my other project, [Yabai-Spaces plugin for Bitbar](https://github.com/SxC97/Yabai-Spaces). Check it out!
