# Description
This is a cobbling together of Joel Eisners [Binary Clock Widget](https://github.com/joeleisner/ubersicht-binary-clock), Geoff Olivers [Fuzzy Time Widget](https://github.com/plan8studios/fuzzytime), and Spencer Kaisers [Simple Date Widget](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht-widgets/blob/master/SimpleDate/index.coffee) to recreate Ruunyox's [bklk](https://github.com/Ruunyox/bklk) terminal application. If you like this widget, please checkout everyone listed above, as this project couldn't have been done without their hard work!

# Installation
Drag and drop into the Ubersicht widgets folder

# Dependencies
[Ubersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) and [FuraCode NerdFont Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) although the font can be changed to whatever you want.

# Customization
The time and date widgets should be centered on any display but the binary clock might need to be manually adjusted using the variables at the top of the document.I have included a Laptop version that should already be centered for 13" screens, a Landscape version that should be centered for 27" 4k monitors, and a Portrait version that should be centered for 27" 4k monitors in portrait mode.
